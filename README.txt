WARNING: You don't want to go here.

Know that:
* This is mainly code I've created for art projects.  It is not designed to be reusable.  
* It includes some disgusting hacks that can crash SpaceClaim.
* The UI is awful.
* The code is a terrible mess.
* Over time, and as requested, I will clean up portions and move them to SpaceClaim AddIns, which contains plausibly decent code.  
* If anyone is interested in collaborating to make a capability production-worthy, please reach out!
